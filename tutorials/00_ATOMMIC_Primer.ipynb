    "## Creating Model from constructor vs restoring a model\n",
    "---------\n",
    "\n",
    "You might notice, we discuss all of the above setup methods in the context of model after it is restored. However, ATOMMIC scripts do not call them inside any of the example train scripts themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is because these methods are automatically called by the constructor when the Model is created for the first time, but these methods are skipped during restoration (either from a PyTorch Lightning checkpoint using `load_from_checkpoint`, or via `restore_from` method inside ATOMMIC Models).\n",
    "\n",
    "This is done as most datasets are stored on a user's local directory, and the path to these datasets is set in the config (either set by default, or set by Hydra overrides). On the other hand, the models are meant to be portable. On another user's system, the data might not be placed at exactly the same location, or even on the same drive as specified in the model's config!\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore we allow the constructor some brevity and automate such dataset setup, whereas restoration warns that data loaders were not set up and provides the user with ways to set up their own datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "------\n",
    "\n",
    "Why are optimizers not restored automatically? Well, optimizers themselves don't face an issue, but as we saw before, schedulers depend on the number of train steps in order to calculate their schedule.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, if you don't wish to modify the optimizer and scheduler, and prefer to leave them to their default values, that's perfectly alright. The `setup_optimization()` method is automatically called by PyTorch Lightning for you when you begin training your model!"
